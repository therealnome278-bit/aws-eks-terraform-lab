# AWS EKS Terraform Lab

This repository contains a hands-on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) lab built with **Terraform** and **AWS**, focused on provisioning a production-style **Amazon EKS** environment.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate clean Terraform structure, modular design, and real-world infrastructure patterns rather than toy examples.

## Project Goals
- Build AWS infrastructure using Terraform modules
- Provision an EKS cluster with supporting networking
- Follow production-oriented IaC practices
- Keep the design simple, readable, and extensible

## Tech Stack
- Terraform
- AWS (VPC, EKS, IAM, ECR)
- Kubernetes
- Helm (later stages)
